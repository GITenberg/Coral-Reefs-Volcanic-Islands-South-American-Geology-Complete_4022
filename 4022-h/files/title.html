<center>EDITORIAL NOTE</center>

<p align="justify">Although in some respects more technical in
their subjects and style than Darwin's "Journal," the books here
reprinted will never lose their value and interest for the
originality of the observations they contain. Many parts of them
are admirably adapted for giving an insight into problems regarding
the structure and changes of the earth's surface, and in fact they
form a charming introduction to physical geology and physiography
in their application to special domains. The books themselves
cannot be obtained for many times the price of the present volume,
and both the general reader, who desires to know more of Darwin's
work, and the student of geology, who naturally wishes to know how
a master mind reasoned on most important geological subjects, will
be glad of the opportunity of possessing them in a convenient and
cheap form.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The three introductions, which my friend
Professor Judd has kindly furnished, give critical and historical
information which makes this edition of special value.</p>
